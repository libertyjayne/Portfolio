        <h1>A little about me...</h1>
        <p>I'm a full-stack software engineer. When I'm not getting my thrills building software, I can be found playing roller derby, gardening, reading, traveling, and spending time with my three-legged pug mix.</p>
            
        <p>I'm most experienced in using MySQL, Python, C#, and .Net Core to create RESTful APIs on the backend, as well as Angular, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for dynamic and responsive front end views.</p> 
            
        <p>Feel free to reach out! I am always available and excited to chat about tech, dogs, travel destinations, or just to say hello!</p>
